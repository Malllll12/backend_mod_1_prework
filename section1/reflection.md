## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
This article makes learning sound like a process of constant growth and expansion. It's never-ending. I already read a lot and view learning as a process not a destination. I'd like to become a more effective teacher. I can get frustrated by the process of teaching someone; I need to look at it as expanding my own understanding. I would add that

1. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal? puts "Hello World!"

1. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file? #

1. Explain the difference between an integer and a float? An integer does not have a decimal point. A float does, therefore the float is used when precision is necessary.

1. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`
animal = zebra

1. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?
prints #{animal}

1. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.
Interpolation takes the data type in a variable and substitutes the information into a string.
print "A #{animal} has black and white stripes."
1. What method is used to get input from a user?
gets.chomp
1. Name and describe two common string methods:
Substring calls out part of the whole of the string. .length tells how many characters are in the string.
